<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
In this paper, we propose a novel language design that couples a
type-safe effectful computational language with first-class support
for logical terms like propositions and proofs. We propose this
language in order to mitigate what we perceive as a weakness of current proof
assistants like Coq and Isabelle: the lack of a single language where
users can develop complex tactics and decision procedures in a
typeful manner and using a rich programming model. This limits the scalability
of the proof development process, as users avoid developing
domain-specific tactics and decision procedures.
</p>

<p>
The main idea behind our design is to integrate a logical framework
similar to the one supported by such proof assistants inside the type
system of a computational language inspired by ML. The language design
is such that the added features are orthogonal to the rest of the
computational language, and also does not require significant additions
to the logic language, so soundness is guaranteed. We argue for the
applicability of our approach by showing a number of examples of use.
