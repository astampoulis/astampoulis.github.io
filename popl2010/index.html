<h1>Typed computation of logical terms inside a language with effects</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
In this paper, we propose a novel language design that couples a
type-safe effectful computational language with first-class support
for logical terms like propositions and proofs. As our logical
level we use a small subset of CIC, while our computational language is
inspired by ML. The language design is such that the added features
are orthogonal to the rest of the computational language, and also do
not require changes to the logic language, so soundness is guaranteed.
We argue that such a language design is well-tailored to write tactics
for proof assistants like Coq and Isabelle, and show some initial
examples.
</p>

<p>
A key technical challenge in designing such a language is dealing
successfully with open terms of the logical level. We present a novel
solution to this problem, that maintains type safety while requiring
relatively small programming overhead. We show how it is related to similar
solutions developed for computation with LF terms.
